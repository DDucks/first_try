Dear Dr Rush,
I have re-tested your connection again and can see the speed has improved again, now profiled at 4.7Mbps.
Please monitor the connection and let us know if it drops out again.

You can get back in touch online at http://contactus.plus.net or by phone on 0845 140 0200 if we can be of further assistance.

Kind regards,

Michael Dixon
